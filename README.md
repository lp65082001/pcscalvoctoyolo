 Convert PascalVOC Annotations to YOLO  

 This project can tramform the PascalVOC format to Yolo format  

 -> tranfer.py is tramform code  
 	-> 1. you need to give classname   
 	-> 2. need give the image dir pathway  

 -> list.py can create the image table for yolo (ex. train.txt, test.txt and valid.txt)  
 	-> 1. need give the image dir pathway  
 	-> 2. set output name (ex. train.txt, test.txt and valid.txt)  
 	-> 3. set your data structure for image dir  
  
 Thanks
